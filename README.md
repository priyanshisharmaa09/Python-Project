This project analyzes global illicit financial transaction flows using Python and presents insights through an interactive dashboard. The primary objective is to detect patterns in suspicious transactions, identify high-risk countries, shell company involvement, and trace financial anomalies across categories and regions.

Project Objectives: 

1.Analyze global financial transaction data for potential illicit activities.

2.Identify countries and transaction types with high risk indicators.

3.Build an intuitive dashboard to visualize trends and highlight red flags.

4.Support investigative decision-making with data-driven insights.

 Tools & Technologies: 
 
1.Python: Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.

2.Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

3.Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizations during EDA.

4.Power BI (based on your tool): Final dashboard creation.

5.Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis and visual explanation.
